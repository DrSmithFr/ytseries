##Â Generate your JWT keys

rmms need public/private key to generate JWT tokens. 
Those tokens are used by rmms API for authentication and reconnection mechanisms.

Execute the following commands within `/back` folder

    mkdir -p config/jwt
    
    openssl genrsa -out config/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096
    openssl rsa -pubout -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/public.pem
    openssl rsa -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/private2.pem
    
    mv config/jwt/private2.pem config/jwt/private.pem
    chmod 777 config/jwt/*

## Coding style and Standards

- Respect best practices for [javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) and [php](https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php/blob/master/README.md).
- Respect the [PSR-2 coding standards](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) for all php files.
- Respect [PHP mess detector](https://phpmd.org/rules/index.html).
- Respect [AirBnB standards guideline](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for javascript.

Try to inspire you as mush as you can of [functional programing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84), it will make your code cleaner, reusable and easy to test. 
You will find equivalent in every programming language.
